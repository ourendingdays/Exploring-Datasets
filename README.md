### Car-Evaluation Dataset

#### For evaluating the following famous [Car Evaluation Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation) by Marco Bohavic. 

#### Decision Tree model with entropy and gini index acquired ±78% accuracy score on both criterions.
#### However, Support Vector Michine model with GridSearch found that SVM with ninth degree polynomial brings accuracy score of ±90%

#### Both models are stored in one [car file](Car Evaluation/car.ipynb)
