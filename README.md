## Car-Evaluation Dataset

#### Evaluating the following famous [Car Evaluation Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation) by Marco Bohavic with following two models.

1. Decision Tree model with entropy and gini index acquired ±78% accuracy score on both criterions.
2. However, Support Vector Michine model with GridSearch found that SVM with ninth degree polynomial brings accuracy score of ±90%. More *cleaner* representation of this method you can see in this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/sachsene/car-evaluation-with-svm-and-gridsearch)

#### Both models are stored in one car.ipynb file.

## Student Performance Dataset

#### Evaluating the following famous [Student Performance Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) by Paulo Cortez.

1. Two netobooks:
  1. Student performance - main file with all explanations and procedure
  2. briefly testing models - simple draft for testing model
2. Detailed visualization of feature engineering
3. Detailed explanation of such important things, as scaling, encoding and feature chose
